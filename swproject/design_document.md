# Revenue Recognition System Architecture and Design

## Requirements
- Our company sells three kinds of products: word processors, databases, and spreadsheets.
- According to the rules, when you sign a sales contract for a word processor you can book all the revenue right away. If it's a spreadsheet, you can book one-third today, one-third in sixty days, and one-third in ninety days. If it's a database, you can book one-third today, one-third in thirty days, and one-third in sixty days.
- We need to accurately track the revenue recognition for this company.

## Bounded Context: RevenueRecognition

Responsible for managing revenue recognition for different types of products.

## Modules

- Contract: Handles the sales contract and revenue recognition rules for different products.
- Revenue: Responsible for tracking and calculating revenue recognition.

## Aggregates

- ContractAggregate: Represents the sales contract and is responsible for enforcing revenue recognition rules based on the product type.

## Entities

- Contract: Represents a sales contract with its attributes such as contract ID, product type, contract date, etc.

## Value Objects

- RevenueRecognitionRule: Represents the rules for revenue recognition based on the product type.
- RevenueRecognitionEntry: Represents a revenue recognition entry with attributes like recognition amount, recognition date, etc.

## Domain Events

- ContractSignedEvent: Raised when a sales contract is signed.
- RevenueRecognitionEntryCreatedEvent: Raised when a revenue recognition entry is created.

## Repositories

- ContractRepository: Performs CRUD operations on Contract entities.
- RevenueRecognitionRepository: Performs CRUD operations on RevenueRecognitionEntry entities.
- ReportingRepository: Performs queries for generating reports.

## Factories

- ContractFactory: Responsible for creating Contract entities.
- RevenueRecognitionFactory: Responsible for creating RevenueRecognitionEntry entities.

## Domain Services

- RevenueRecognitionService: Encapsulates the logic for calculating revenue recognition based on the product type and contract rules.

## Presentation Layer

- User Interface: Provides user interaction to create and view sales contracts, revenue recognition entries, and reports.

## Application Layer

- ContractService: Handles the creation and retrieval of sales contracts.
- RevenueRecognitionService: Handles the creation and retrieval of revenue recognition entries.
- ReportService: Generates revenue recognition reports.

## Infrastructure Layer

- Database: Persists contract and revenue recognition data.
- Event Store: Stores domain events.
- Message Queue: Enables asynchronous processing of events.
- Reporting Framework: Used for generating reports.

## Enterprise Architecture Patterns and Improvements

- Event Sourcing: Store all state changes as domain events to maintain an audit log and enable replayability.
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): Separate the read and write models for contracts and revenue recognition to optimize performance.
- Asynchronous Event-Driven Communication: Integrate an Event Bus to enable communication between contexts using domain events.
- Data Replication and Caching: Replicate relevant data from ContractAggregate to the Reporting context and implement caching mechanisms to improve performance.
- Validation and Error Handling: Add validation checks and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and handle exceptions gracefully.
- Security and Access Control: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control user access to sensitive data.
