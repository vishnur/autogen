According to the rules, when you sign a contract for a word processor you can book all the revenue right away. If it’s a spreadsheet, you can book one-third today, one-third in sixty days, and one-third in ninety days. If it’s a database, you can book one-third today, one-third in thirty days, and one-third in sixty days. I want help in building an enterprise application to accurately track revenue recognition. BUILD THE APPLICATION only after all the design work is completed and everyone in the team knows what to do in which order.
